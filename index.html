                            Professor Muhammad Yunus established the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in 1983, fueled by the belief that credit is a fundamental human right. His objective was to help poor people escape from poverty by providing loans on terms suitable to them and by teaching them a few sound financial principles so they could help themselves.
                            
                            From Dr. Yunus’ personal loan of small amounts of money to destitute basketweavers in Bangladesh in the mid-70s, the Grameen Bank has advanced to the forefront of a burgeoning world movement toward eradicating poverty through microlending. Replicas of the Grameen Bank model operate in more than 100 countries worldwide.
                            Born in 1940 in the seaport city of Chittagong, Professor Yunus studied at Dhaka University in Bangladesh, then received a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University. He received his Ph.D. in economics from Vanderbilt in 1969 and the following year became an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University. Returning to Bangladesh, Yunus headed the economics department at Chittagong University.

                            From 1993 to 1995, Professor Yunus was a member of the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women, a post to which he was appointed by the UN secretary general. He has served on the Global Commission of Women’s Health, the Advisory Council for Sustainable Economic Development and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance.

                            Professor Yunus is the recipient of numerous international awards for his ideas and endeavors, including the Mohamed Shabdeen Award for Science (1993), Sri Lanka; Humanitarian Award (1993), CARE, USA; World Food Prize (1994), World Food Prize Foundation, USA; lndependence Day Award (1987), Bangladesh’s highest award; King Hussein Humanitarian Leadership Award (2000), King Hussien Foundation, Jordan; Volvo Environment Prize (2003), Volvo Environment Prize Foundation, Sweden; Nikkei Asia Prize for Regional Growth (2004), Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan; Franklin D. Roosevelt Freedom Award (2006), Roosevelt Institute of The Netherlands; and the Seoul Peace Prize (2006), Seoul Peace Prize Cultural Foundation, Seoul, Korea. He is a member of the board of the United Nations Foundation."</p>

                        <p>Shahjahan Mahmood, chairman of the Bangladesh Satellite Company Ltd, has said that the deal for the second satellite will be finalized within two or three months and it will be launched in two or three years.
                        The second satellite will be a Bangladesh Earth Observatory Satellite, he said.

                        He was speaking at the sixth anniversary of the successful launching of the Bangabandhu-1, the country's first communication satellite at Dhaka Club on Sunday night.

                        <p>The satellite will be used for various purposes, including monitoring natural disasters, managing agricultural resources, assessing environmental changes, and more.
                        Shahjahan expressed his optimism that the lifetime of the first satellite could be increased by three years to 18 years due to the efficient launch.
                        The satellite was launched in May 2018 under a project costing Tk2,765.66 crore.       
                        Forty private television stations and three channels of state-run Bangladesh Television now air programs using Bangabandhu-1.        
                        It started providing Television Rating Point services recently.</p>
